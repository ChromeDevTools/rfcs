# Chrome DevTools RFC

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is to validate the design with the community, solicit feedback on open questions.

Many changes, including bug fixes and features improvements can be implemented and reviewed via our normal workflow on [crbug](https://crbug.com).

Some changes though are "substantial". These changes need to put through a bit of a design process.

## How to participate?
